            <p>This website was built and designed by me, however poorly, to represent me and store my ideas.</p>
            <p>My goal is to fill this website with a bunch of ideas and things that are authentically me while learning how to maintain a git repo and website.</p>
            <p>I'm sure it's not the prettiest it can be or will be, but I'm working on it.</p>
